### 🧠 **"PerceptFlow" – A Human Perception Simulation Lab**

**Overview:**  
A full-stack web app that lets users explore and simulate perceptual phenomena—like motion compensation, luminance adaptation, and visual illusions—through interactive experiments and real-time data visualizations.

### 🚀 Why It's a Great Fit

- **Cognitive Modeling Playground**: Integrate modular simulations of perceptual systems, ideal for testing hypotheses or demonstrating cognitive models.
- **Usability First**: Use your design fluency to create interfaces that are intuitive and efficient for researchers and curious learners.
- **Systems Thinking in Action**: Let users define feedback loops or adaptive behaviors in visual modules (e.g., how changing luminance triggers neural compensation).
- **Open-source Ready**: Could be extended with Ollama integrations or serve as a frontend for Python-based perception APIs.
